Seminar 3 of the video part from the audio and video encoding systems course.</br>

The material folder is not in the repository due to the size of the BBB video, if this is a problem please contact me.

Thank you.

## Exercise 2 answer

For each codec of the videos used in the mosaic we have these different bitrates (at 720p resolution):

- VP8: 1162 kb/s
- VP9: 3210 kb/s
- H.256: 1092 kb/s
- AV1: 3634 kb/s

Visually, at 720p, we can percieve minimal quality differences in the video mosaic, which are directly related to these bitrates. We have that AV1 has the best quality, followed by VP9. In the other resolutions the difference in quality is more noticeable.
